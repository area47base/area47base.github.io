             Classified Cats is a set of 7400 mys-curious cats that originated from the Area47 research facility as the genesis project. Nobody exactly knows why or how these cats came into existence, but it will be a fun filled journey trying to solve the mystery.<br><br>
             
             Throughout this mysterious adventure Classified Cat owners can look forward to multiple utilities, while Area47 revolutionises the web3.0 space.

                <h3>Area47's plans to revolutionize the NFT space</h3>
                  <p><br>
                  Area47 plans to revolutionize the NFT space by developing a base for multichain-NFT projects and dapps.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Area47 aims to produce beautiful NFT art for the community, as we believe that the art should be the main utility of any NFT,
                  while also trying to incorporate special features or utilities into all our NFTs. 
                  We want to collaborate with other projects, artists and developers to build a strong foundation in the web3.0 space for all to enjoy and appreciate
                  in multiple areas, be it art, metaverse games or even physical products. No plans are certain, but no plans are off the table either.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This means that there will be opportunities for our holders to take part in this spectacular journey to make this dream a reality.
                  Our Discord server is always open and we invite you to join the fun as well as the discussions. PS.. We like memes, cats, space and art and 
                  will be sharing interesting and fun content on these topics, but also lots more.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We also aim to share some education on our social channels for our holders
                  on topics such as web3.0 and space facts or other relevant topics our holders might want to hear about.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We are taking this base to the moon, are you coming along?

                        Huge treasure hunt to discover what happened at the Area47 research facility with large prize pool up for grabs.

                        Some holders will be whitelisted for the next project based on specific conditions and a snap shot period.

                        We are planning to give to non-profit organizations using an allocation set aside, from the project launch date,
                        for this specifically. The world is in need of some love and hope, and we believe that our community has a lot of potential
                        to help in areas where it is most needed. Details will be discussed at a later stage and we will invite holders to join in on
                        these discussions.
